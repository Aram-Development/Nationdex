> Ariel Aram was banned from Ballsdex server under immediate decision from **thebicfish** to take strict measures for the last involvement of both of them and some other people in the AsiaDex drama on September 2024. We are still providing the links to the [original Ballsdex server](https://discord.gg/PKKhee4fvy) and [the wiki](https://github.com/laggron42/BallsDex-Discordbot/wiki), but we will not be affiliated with them in the soon future.
